# Mpuza frontend challenge - Countries App

![Countries App](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Greetings from Mpuza Team, Let's see your coding vibe & techniques!

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Use the following tools:

- Nextjs (with Typescript)
- Redux toolkit (With rtk query)
- Tailwind
- And [antd](https://ant.design)

Users of the Countries App should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## Where to find everything (assets and styles guide)

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. So, you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets (like images, ...) for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and you can use an icon font library for the icons [React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building the app

1. Create a github repo call it `leila-countries-app`
2. Create a branch called dev
3. Build the app within the dev branch
4. When you are done push, push your changes and create a PR (request to merge into main branch)
5. And then merge the PR for yourself!

## Deploying the app

Host the app on

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Submitting your solution

Send an email containing App's DEMO Link to `tunezepatrick@gmail.com` and cc `ydiasniyonshuti@yahoo.fr`

## Deadline

On Thusday, 01 December 2022 at 7:00 PM. At this exact time will have a call for you to demo it.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
